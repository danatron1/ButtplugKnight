# Buttplug Knight

For when you want to feel a little less hollow.

## Requirements

You will need:
* A wifi-enabled vibrator toy (only tested with Lovense)
* A bluetooth 5.0 dongle for your PC
* A copy of [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/)
* [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/) installed

If you have a bluetooth dongle but are unsure if it's compatible, install Intiface Central and scan for devices. If it can find your vibrator, it should work.

## Rules

When you take damage, it will buzz at 50% power for 5 seconds. (Double damage hits are 100% power for 10 seconds)

When you heal, it will buzz at 10% power for 1 second.

If one of the above triggers while it is still vibrating, the effect and duration will be **doubled**. This means that if you take a regular hit, then take another before the 5 seconds are up, you will have an additional 10 seconds at 100% power.
